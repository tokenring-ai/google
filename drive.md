This guide explains how the Google Drive API supports several ways to search files
and folders.

You can use the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method on the
[`files`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) resource to return all or some of a
Drive user's files and folders. The `list` method can also be
used to retrieve the `fileId` required for some resource methods (such as the
[`get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/get) method and the [`update`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/update)) method.

## Use the fields parameter

If you want to specify the fields to return in the response, you can set the
`fields` [system
parameter](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters#definitions)
with any method of the `files` resource. If you omit the `fields` parameter, the
server returns a default set of fields specific to the method. For example, the
[`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method returns only the `kind`, `id`,
`name`, `mimeType`, and `resourceKey` fields for each file. To return different
fields, see [Return specific fields](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/fields-parameter).

## Get a file

To get a file, use the [`get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/get) method on the
[`files`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) resource with the `fileId` path parameter.
If you don't know the file ID, you can [list all files](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/search-files#all) using the `list`
method.

The method returns the file as an instance of a `files` resource. If you provide
the `alt=media` query parameter, then the response includes the file contents in
the response body. To download or export the file, see [Download and export
files](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-downloads).

To acknowledge the risk of downloading known malware or other
[abusive](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148505) files, set the
`acknowledgeAbuse` query parameter to `true`. This field is only applicable when
the `alt=media` parameter is set and the user is either the file owner or an
organizer of the shared drive in which the file resides.

## Search for all files and folders on the current user's My Drive

Use the `list` method without any parameters to return all files and folders.

    GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files

## Search for specific files or folders on the current user's My Drive

To search for a specific set of files or folders, use the query string `q` field
with the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method to filter the files to
return by combining one or more search terms.

The query string syntax contains the following three parts:

*`query_term operator values`*

Where:

- *`query_term`* is the query term or field to search upon.

- *`operator`* specifies the condition for the query term.

- *`values`* are the specific values you want to use to filter your search
  results.

For example, the following query string filters the search to only return
folders by setting the [MIME type](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/mime-types):

    q: mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'

To view all file query terms, see [File-specific query terms](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/ref-search-terms#file-properties).

To view all query operators that you can use to construct a query, see [Query
operators](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/ref-search-terms#operators).

### Query string examples

The following table lists examples of some basic query strings. The actual code
differs depending on the client library you use for your search.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** The following query terms use fields from the [Drive API
> v3](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3). Some resource fields changed between v2 and v3. For example, `name` replaces `title`. If you're using [Drive API
> v2](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v2), adjust these queries to use the v2 fields. For more information, see [Drive API v2 and v3 comparison
> reference](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/v2-to-v3-reference).

You must also escape special characters in your file names to make sure the
query works correctly. For example, if a filename contains both an apostrophe
(`'`) and a backslash (`"\"`) character, use a backslash to escape them: `name
contains 'quinn\'s paper\\essay'`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** These examples use the unencoded `q` parameter, where `name = 'hello'` is encoded as `name+%3d+%27hello%27`. Client libraries handle this encoding automatically.

| What you want to query | Example |
|---|---|
| Files with the name "hello" | `name = 'hello'` |
| Files with a name containing the words "hello" and "goodbye" | `name contains 'hello' and name contains 'goodbye'` |
| Files with a name that does not contain the word "hello" | `not name contains 'hello'` |
| Files that contain the text "important" and in the trash | `fullText contains 'important' and trashed = true` |
| Files that contain the word "hello" | `fullText contains 'hello'` |
| Files that don't have the word "hello" | `not fullText contains 'hello'` |
| Files that contain the exact phrase "hello world" | `fullText contains '"hello world"'` |
| Files with a query that contains the "\\" character (for example, "\\authors") | `fullText contains '\\authors'` |
| Files that are folders | `mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'` |
| Files that are not folders | `mimeType != 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'` |
| Files modified after a given date (default time zone is UTC) | `modifiedTime > '2012-06-04T12:00:00'` |
| Image or video files modified after a specific date | `modifiedTime > '2012-06-04T12:00:00' and (mimeType contains 'image/' or mimeType contains 'video/')` |
| Files that are starred | `starred = true` |
| Files within a collection (for example, the folder ID in the `parents` collection) | `'1234567' in parents` |
| Files in an [application data folder](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/appdata) in a collection | `'appDataFolder' in parents` |
| Files for which user "test@example.org" is the owner | `'test@example.org' in owners` |
| Files for which user "test@example.org" has write permission | `'test@example.org' in writers` |
| Files for which members of the group "group@example.org" have write permission | `'group@example.org' in writers` |
| Files shared with the authorized user with "hello" in the name | `sharedWithMe and name contains 'hello'` |
| Files with a custom file property visible to all apps | `properties has { key='mass' and value='1.3kg' }` |
| Files with a custom file property private to the requesting app | `appProperties has { key='additionalID' and value='8e8aceg2af2ge72e78' }` |
| Files that have not been shared with anyone or domains (only private, or shared with specific users or groups) | `visibility = 'limited'` |

### Filter search results with a client library

The following code sample shows how to use a client library to filter search
results to file names and IDs of JPEG files. This sample uses the `mimeType`
query term to narrow results to files of type `image/jpeg`. It also sets
`spaces` to `drive` to further narrow the search to the [Drive
space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/about-files#org). When `nextPageToken` returns `null`,
there are no more results.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If you're using the older Drive API v2, you can find code samples in [GitHub](https://github.com/googleworkspace). Learn how to [migrate to Drive API v3](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/migrate-to-v3).

       echo "Error Message: ".$e;
    }
}
```

## Search for files with a custom file property

To search for files with a custom file property, use either the `properties` or
the `appProperties` search query term with a key and value. For example, to
search for a custom file property that's private to the requesting app called
`additionalID` with a value of `8e8aceg2af2ge72e78`:

    appProperties has { key='additionalID' and value='8e8aceg2af2ge72e78' }

For more information, see [Add custom file
properties](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/properties).

## Search for files with a specific label or field value

To search for files with specific labels, use the `labels` search query term
with a specific label ID. For example: `'labels/LABEL_ID' in
labels`. If successful, the response body contains all file instances where the
label's applied.

To search for files without a specific label ID: `Not
'labels/LABEL_ID' in labels`.

You can also search for files based on specific field values. For example, to
search for files with a text value:
`labels/LABEL_ID.text_field_id ='TEXT'`.

For more information, see [Search for files with a specific label or field
value](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/search-labels).

## Search the corpora

By default, the `user` item collection is set on the [`corpora`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.corpora) query parameter
when the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method is used. To search other
item collections, such as those shared with a `domain`, you must explicitly set
the `corpora` parameter.

You can search multiple corpora in a single query; however, if the combined
corpora is too large, the API might return incomplete results. Check the
[`incompleteSearch`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list#body.FileList.FIELDS.incomplete_search)
field in the response body. If it's `true`, then some documents were omitted. To
resolve this, narrow the `corpora` to use either `user` or `drive`.

When using the
[`orderBy`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.order_by) query
parameter on the `list` method, avoid using the `createdTime` key for queries on
large item collections as it requires additional processing and it might result
in timeouts or other issues. For time-related sorting on large item collections,
you can use `modifiedTime` instead as it's optimized to handle these queries.
For example, `?orderBy=modifiedTime`.

If you omit the `orderBy` query parameter, there's no default sort order and the
items are returned arbitrarily.
